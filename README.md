Part 2 of Your Brute-Force Toolkit

This section focuses on the second phase of your brute-force attacks. Hereâ€™s how you can start pentesting hash-protected passwords:

Use a decryption tool to target and decrypt passwords hashed with SHA1, MD5, or Bcrypt.
Input your password, for example, test, into the decryption tool.
Take the resulting hash value and proceed with brute-force testing.
Insert the hash value into your brute-force tool and allow it to run until the hash is decrypted.
